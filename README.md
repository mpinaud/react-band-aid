#### A record collection management application _2018_

#### Reconfiguration by **Mikey Pinaud***

## Description

#### So far reconfiguring the first layer of BandAid from Angular to React seemed a lot more simple than the initial project set-up. I'm still curious come the next few weeks curriculum on state changes and API calling but all in all this transformation has been very smooth. Building out a framework definitely helps with the process.

BandAid is a record collection management application. Users will be able to search for a band's records through the BandAid interface which utilizes the Discogs API. Users will be able to sign up for a profile with a name, email, and password. Users with a profile will be able to add records to their collection or wishlist. Users will be able to manage their collection and wishlist by adding and removing entries, or by moving entries from the wishlist to the collection. User will be able to look at an Artists page and see if they are currently touring which is being utilized by the Bands On Tour API.

## Notes

  Haven't faced any problems or reached any obstacles reconfiguring from Angular to React as of yet. ðŸ˜Ž

  Reconstructing my component tree from more of a browser routing to component routing that includes all my functions, and where to place state components. This is taking way more time to figure out. For now I'm going to start simple with the sign-up form with in app will hold my state to create new user profile in profiles.
